The `/negotiationarena` directory is taken from https://github.com/vinid/NegotiationArena, the code repository for the paper *How Well Can LLMs Negotiate? NegotiationArena Platform and Analysis* by Federico Bianchi, Patrick John Chia, Mert Yuksekgonul, Jacopo Tagliabue, Dan Jurafsky, and James Zou (2024). 

We use it as a starting point to set up our own custom negotiation environments and agents, adapting it as needed to suit the purposes of this project.
